2. C's Get Degrees

3. Project Objective
Goal was to create a game menu that implemnted a few different games that could be called up using the buttons.

8. Demo
The Demo went smoothly and was presented well, No mess ups and everything worked out well.

9. Summary
Our project is name Micro Boi our main objective of the application was to be able to reproduce Simple games on a hand held devices like they used to hand out at McDonalds when we were younger. We started looking for ideas online of what we can use the micro bit for. I ran in to a video on YouTube That enables the micro bit to play flappy bird a simple game that became very popular and took the world By storm in 2013. The idea for the game was to make a bird fly over pipes and however many you passed pipes With ought hitting the pipe would be your score. Andrew and Jose helped me do some additional research on how games Function on the micro bit and how we would convert code to enable it to work with the micro bit. David started developing code to do a test on the micro bit we started with rock paper scissors and eventually Added in coin flip which are basic ones. Upon successfully adding 2 games we were going to add the flappy bird Game itself but ran in to issues because it would break the rest of the code we were able to figure Out that the games have to be separated in to classes and definitions so they wouldn’t interfere with each other. Our research consisted mainly of looking at videos as well as going to forums and finding solutions and workarounds For the issues we were having. We found the best way to develop the application was trial and error we would implement code And try out the game and see what results we would get. At one point we implemented code without being able To make the games work it would freeze so we would try out different calling functions and turned the games in to classes them self’s so They wouldn’t interfere.
